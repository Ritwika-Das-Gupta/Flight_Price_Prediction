# Flight_Price_Prediction
In this project we a re considering a data set to predict flight prices using Decision Tree model.
Flight price prediction is a data science and machine learning application aimed at forecasting the cost of airline tickets. This type of prediction is valuable for travelers, travel agencies, and airlines, as it can help travelers find the best deals, assist travel agencies in setting prices, and enable airlines to optimize revenue management. Here's a description of the key components and steps involved in flight price prediction:

**1. Data Collection:**
   - Gathering historical flight pricing data is the foundation of flight price prediction. This data includes information on flight routes, departure and arrival cities, dates, airlines, ticket prices, booking class, time until departure, and more.

**2. Data Preprocessing:**
   - Data cleaning and preprocessing are essential to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset.
   - Feature engineering may be performed to create new variables or transform existing ones.
   - 
**3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
   - EDA is conducted to gain insights into the dataset, identify patterns, and understand the relationships between different variables. Visualization techniques are often used to explore the data.

**4. Model Selection:**
   - Machine learning models are chosen based on the nature of the problem. Common choices include regression models (e.g., linear regression), time series models , decision tree, and more advanced techniques like random forests, gradient boosting, or neural networks. Here decision tree is used to predict price as it had highest accuracy during cross validataion
   - Some models are specifically designed for time series forecasting, which is common in flight price prediction due to the temporal nature of ticket prices.

**5. Model Training:**
   - The historical flight pricing data is split into training and validation sets for model training and evaluation.
   - Features derived from historical flight and external data are used to predict ticket prices.

**6. Model Evaluation:**
   - The model's performance is assessed using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), or others relevant to regression tasks.
   - Cross-validation may be used to ensure the model generalizes well to unseen data.

**7. Deployment:**
   - Once a satisfactory model is trained, it can be deployed as part of a web application, API, or integrated into travel booking websites and apps for real-time price predictions.

**8. Real-Time Prediction:**
   - In a production environment, the model receives real-time inputs, such as the user's travel preferences (e.g., destination, departure date, class of service), and returns price predictions for specific flights.

**9. Continuous Monitoring and Retraining:**
    - The model's performance should be continuously monitored in production to ensure it remains accurate and up-to-date.
    - Regularly retraining the model with new pricing data is important to account for changing pricing patterns and improving prediction accuracy.

**10. User Interface:**
    - A user-friendly interface, such as a travel booking website or app, can provide travelers with real-time flight price predictions and help them find the best deals.

Flight price prediction systems empower travelers to make informed decisions about booking flights, enable travel agencies to offer competitive pricing, and assist airlines in optimizing revenue by dynamically adjusting ticket prices. These systems rely on historical data, sophisticated modeling techniques, and continuous monitoring to provide accurate and valuable predictions.
